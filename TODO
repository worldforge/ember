TODO LIST
---------

* terrain
	-better use of GPU shaders (both vertex and pixel shaders)
	-optimize material better
	
* foliage
	-research the best way to present foliage, perhaps it would be better to not use static geometry but use a fixed set of entites instead?

* implement time
	* see if it's possible to use the calendar functionlity from Sear
	* make the sun move over the sky, changing the light and the shadows
	* see if it's possible to use Caelum, the Ogre add in project

* settings
	* add ability to edit the settings from the console - done
	* add widgets for editing the settings, this could in this stage just be a very crude but powerful mechanism for changing all kind of settings
	* add a control center for easy editing of the settings
	
	
* a map widget, which shows a map of the world. Perhaps the paging scene manager can help here?
* add a constant-running key
* move the input system to something more like the one used in sear, which will allow the user to define the key bindings for different actions
* add a basepoint editor
* add a check for nvidia cards and SGI Mesa libGL, and if so warn the user
* show ping
* add the players position with the debug widget - done through the inspect widget
* modify ogre so that the window manager icon can be set - done
* add a generic system for defining bindings between entity attributes and model attributes. Like an extension of how it's possible to currently connect an attribute to a particle system property, but much more generic. This will mean for example that the way of defining how a model is scaled will be deprecated, to be replaced by a more generic system.
* allow dynamic placement of entities. It should be possible to drag and drop an entity into the world and see a "preview" 3d-representation (perphaps with a translucent material)
* add a widget for creating and editing atlas type definition. There's already example code in cyphesis.
* add widget for editing and creating entity media definitions. It should be possible from within Ember to create a whole new media type definition and save it. - done

* refactor EmberOgre into smaller subcomponents
* refactor platform specific code into separate classes sharing a common interface, instead of using #ifdefs
