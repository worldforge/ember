#           Especialized 2D data loader.
#           Currently the only available loaders are

#############COLOR MAP

# Map that user have generated before, using terragen,
#and want to split or to light (Textureformat=Image)

# HERE IS WHERE YOU SPECIFY YOUR NEEDS
#
# If you want your map to be infinitizable
InfiniteMap=no

# If you want smooth your heightmap
HeightMapBlurFactor=0.0f
# Make sure heights use the whole range (0-255 or 0-65535)
Equalize=no
# usual 8 bits HeightMap (terrain scene manager)
HeightMap=yes
# Creates a MiniMap (width=numpageswidth*numtiles and height=numpagesheight*numtiles)
# (as the name don't tell, it's creates a file.small.png image...)
MiniMap=no
MiniMapWidth=512

#########NORMALS
#
# Normal Map
NormalMap=yes
# RGB as XYZ normal and Alpha as 8 bits HeightMap (paging scene manager)
HeightNormalMap=yes

# Map that can be used on not too much scaled terrain or old hardware
# no enough texture units or too slow multipass (Textureformat=Image)
ColorMapGenerated=no
# same but with modulated with light

#########SPLATTING

#
#           Splatting
#               We are allowing 4 textures to build the terrain texture
#               MaterialHeight to change alpha weights ( using percentage )
MaterialHeight1=12

# Base map for big scale maps, used for long distance instead of splatting
# (Textureformat=Base and splattingX)
BaseMap=yes
# same but with modulated with light
LitBaseMap=no
#
#### Maps used for splattings
#
# coverage is RGBA, each channel has info for 1 splat
# (Textureformat=splatting3)
CoverageMap=yes
#
# generate 1 alpha map per splatting
# (Textureformat=splatting2) When Ogre has support fo PF_A8
AlphaMaps=yes
# same but with black RGB data until Ogre has support fo PF_A8
AlphaSplatRGBAMaps=no
# same but with light in RGB data
AlphaSplatLightMaps=no
#
# generate 1 RGB map per splatting gray level instead of alpha
# (mainly debug, but can be used to get some splatting in GL version one day)
RGBMaps=no

######## Real-Time LIGHTING

# Horizon Mapping (real-time lightmapping shader with V2 pixel shader)
# LONG TIME COMPUTATION
HorizonMap=no
# map elevation lookup table independant, so generate once and rename according to your materials.
ElevationMap=no

# trick Real-Time mapping : sun is constricted in Z axis. Fastest Horizon mapping possible with and without shaders.
ZHorizon=yes


########VISIBILITY
#
# PVS (potential visibility set)
# VERY LONG TIME COMPUTATION
# Will be used to decide if terrain patches are visible or hidden by some hills
# or mountains (not used for now in plugin's code)
# could be used for AI to know if something is visible from a point to another...
# so perhaps a thing that can lies in scenemanagers...
