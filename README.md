Ember is the client for the [WorldForge](http://worldforge.org/ "The main Worldforge site") virtual world system.
It can be used for playing and exploring as well as authoring.

That means that if you're a player who wants to explore a virtual world hosted by a Worldforge server, this is the
client for you.
And if you're a world builder who wants to build your own world, this is also the client for you.

To learn more about Worldforge visit our [website](http://worldforge.org/ "The main Worldforge site").

## Installation

The simplest way to install all required dependencies is by using [Conan](https://www.conan.io).

```bash
conan remote add worldforge https://artifactory.ogenvik.org/artifactory/api/conan/conan
conan install . --build missing -c tools.system.package_manager:mode=install -c tools.system.package_manager:sudo=True
cmake --preset conan-release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./build/install/release
cmake --build --preset conan-release -j --target all --target install
```

Alternatively you can use the [Hammer](http://wiki.worldforge.org/wiki/Hammer_Script "The Hammer script") tool to
compile Ember.
This is script provided by the Worldforge project which will download and install all of the required libraries and
components used by Worldforge.

### Tests

The test suite can be built and run using the ```check``` target. For example:

```bash
make check
```

or

```bash
cmake --build --preset conan-release --target check
```

### API documentation

If Doxygen is available API documentation can be generated using the ```dox``` target. For example:

```bash
make dox
```

or

```bash
cmake --build --preset conan-release --target dox
```

### Working with media

An alternative to the ```media-download``` target is to instead use the raw media repo source, as found at
https://svn.worldforge.org:886/svn/media/trunk/. If you intend to edit or add new media you probably want this instead.

The target ```mediarepo-checkout``` will use Subversion to checkout the repository to the ```mediarepo``` directory.
When running a non-release build Ember will automatically load media from this directory.
Note that this might lead to longer start times, as more files needs to be processed.

In addition, there's a ```mediarepo-process``` target which processes the media from the media repository, as fetched
by ```mediarepo-checkout```, and places the results in the build directory, under a subdirectory named
```ember-media-<version>```.
When running a non-release build Ember will automatically load media from this directory, taking precedence over the
```mediarepo``` directory.

## Dependencies

We use Conan for our dependency handling. If you're developing locally you can issue this command to setup both a "debug" and "release" environment.
```bash
conan install -s build_type=Debug . --build missing -c tools.system.package_manager:mode=install -c tools.system.package_manager:sudo=True --update  && conan install . --build missing -c tools.system.package_manager:mode=install -c tools.system.package_manager:sudo=True --update
```

## Running Ember

As Ember is a 3d client it requires a 3d capable graphics card. If you have a fairly recent machine you should be good
though.

If you want to run Ember as a world builder tool we strongly recommend that you also install and run a local instance of
the [Cyphesis](https://github.com/worldforge/cyphesis "Cyphesis server") server.
By running an instance of the Cyphesis server on your local machine you're automatically given administrative access to
the world, and can build and alter it however you like.
Just as with Ember we recommend that you use the
[Hammer](http://wiki.worldforge.org/wiki/Hammer_Script "The Hammer script") tool to compile Cyphesis.
